# STAT 231 Blog project template

The instructor will create a landing page that links to all the blog posts generated by project groups this semester. 

The landing page will include an image and a blurb for each blog. The blurb will be the first paragraph of your blog page, and the image will be taken from your blog team's logo or blog page. If you'd like to request a specific image for your group on the landing page, let the instructor know by May 2.
